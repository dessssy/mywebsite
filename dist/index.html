                        Comming from a small town in Central Bulgaria my main goal always was to live and work in The Big city.</br> I've always had an interest in new stuff but I was affraid to ask how or why. The time I was growing up so were the technologies. Everytime somebody got a computer or a cellphone I was there to see what it looked like and how it worked.

                        <p class="text"> Ever since I was a student I had my mind on technologies and art. The 2nd became my Bachelor degree and later on was time for the main target. Figuring out how can I combine both of my interests was a prior. Attending a Front-end course set the beginning of a long waited journey. Graduating a Software Academy years later gave me the confidence to move forward and the rest is to be written.

While learning the basic web technologies I also came across some new softwares and graphic elements. More is to be done and even more to be learned.</p>

                <p class="text project-text">As a teenager I was fantasizing for a platform similar to what we know today as OneDrive by Microsoft.I had problem with constantly losing my flashdrives and SD cards and some important data along with it. That's how the idea of such platform poped out in my head and the only thing needed was a device such as PC or cellphone with internet to reach all your files. Not knowing what it really takes to build such app I was amazed of how writting small lines of code can make your browser show what you want. That was my comming back to Technologies after years of LIFE.

                <p class="text project-text">In the academy I learned a lot about JavaScript but I was far from calling myself a confident programmer. I learned about variables,hoisting, OOP and how to manipulate my HMTL and CSS with JavaScript, how to 'listen' for events and how to play with them but it is not enough to understand what the language can do. I made this app with online help and it showed me a whole new area of programming. Comming across with actual use of an API and unite it with my knowledge and understanding only increases my thirst for more.
